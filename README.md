# ECE2514_Project_Installment_4
Repository for sharing the code files each group member is working individually.

The goal is that code can be accessed from any machine, and a backup copy is kept even if local copies get corrupted or lost.

While most work will be done individually, this will allow each member to contribute to all aspects of the project.

As we developed each file, we used github to backup out work and share the files so anyone could download them and run the code from their machine. This helped during both development and testing, as everyone could access every file at any time.

We also uploaded all text files that were used for the fpl language. This created a record of our development process in making the actual drone flight plan, and again allowed every member to have access to the files. One instance in particular this was helpful was while Julie was testing in her appartment, Tilden was able to fix errors from campus, allowing the process to continue faster and smoother.

The final output text file was upload for consistency and finality.
